To Do list for gosub:

__ figure out if we should trim trailing whitespace
__ make recursive substitution predictable: just keep running up to, say, 10 times?
__ identify lines with possible substitution? more efficient, enables default-empty
__ optionally replace nonexistent/undefined vars with ""
++ don't replace if \$ (ugh)
++ drop outer " or ' IF BOTH THERE.
